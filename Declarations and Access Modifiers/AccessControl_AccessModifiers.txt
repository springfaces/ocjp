Java Source file Structure:

	A java program can contain any no of classes but atmost one class can be declared as public. If ther is apublic classs
	the name of the progrma and name of public class must match otherwise we will get a compile time errro.

	If there is no public class then we can use any name as Java source file name, there is no restriciton.

		ex:  class A {} class B{} class C {}

			Raghu.java or MyClass.java ect...


	case 1: If there is no public class then we can use any name as java source file 
		ex: A.java or B.java Or c.java or Ant.java....

	case 2: If the class B is declared as public then if you save the source file with A.java in this case we will get compile
		time error. 
			ce: "Class B is public should be declard in a file name B.java" very very important 


	case 3: If we declare Both A and B classes as public and name of the  program as B.java then we will get compile time error 
		saying Class A is public shoulb b e declared in a file named A.java
	

	Note: It is highly recommended to take one class per java source file and name of the file and that class name must be matched 
	      this approach improves code readability.
