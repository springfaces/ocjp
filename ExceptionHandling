Exception: When unwanted, unexpected event that disterbs normal flow of program is called Exception
     ex: Sleeping Exception, FileNotFoundException
    
It is highly recommended to handle exceptoins, the main objective of exception handling is "Graceful termination of the program"

Exception handling dosenot mean repairing an exception, when we have to define alternative way to continue rest of the program
normally this is nothing but Exception Handling

Ex: If our program requiremet is to read data form remote location and at runtime if that file is not available our program should
    not be terminated abnormally. We have to provide an alternative by providing a local file to continue the program execution with
    out any interruption this process is called Exception handling.
    
          try {
            //some code
          } catch(FileNotFoundException e) {
            use local file location if you have an exception.
          }
          

Runtime stack Mechanism:

-> For every Thread jvm will crate a Runtimestack
-> All method calls performed by the thread will be stored in this stack
-> Each entry in the thread is called Activiation record or stack frame
-> After completing the method call JVM delets the corresponding entry from the stack.
-> After completing all methodcalls, just before the terminating the thread jvm destoryes the stack.
