## Oracle certified Java Programmer exam - 1


## Java Basics
  * Define the scope of variable
  * Define the structure of a java class
  * Create executable java application with a main method, run a java program form the command line, produce console output
  * Import other java packages to make them accessible in your code
  * Compare and contrast the features and components of java such as: platform independence, object orientation,     encapsulation


## Working with Java Data types
  * Declare and initialize variable(including casting of primitive data types)
  * Differentiate between object reference variables and primitive data variables
  * Know how to read or write to object field
  * Explain an Object life cycle(Creation reassignment and garbage collection)
  * Develop code that uses wrapper classes such as Boolean, Double and Integer

## Using Operators and Declaration Constructs
  * Use Java operators; use parentheses to override operator precedence
  * Test equality between strings and other objects using == and .equals
  * Care if and if/else and ternary construct
  * Use switch statement

## Creating and Using Arrays
  * Declare, Instantiate, Initialize and use a one-dimensional array
  * Declare, Instantiate, Initialize and use multi-dimensional arrays

## Using Operators and Decision Constructs
  * Use Java Operators; Use parentheses to override operator precedence
  * Test equality between String and other objects using == and equals()
  * Create if and if/else and ternary constructs
  * Use a switch statement

## Working with Methods and Encapsulation
  * Create methods with arguments and return values; including overloaded methods
  * Apply the static keyword to methods and fields 
  * Create and overload constructors; differentiate between default and user defined constructors
  * Apply access modifiers
  * Apply encapsulation principles to class
  * Determine the effect upon object reference and primitive values when they are passed into methods 
    that change the values

## Handling Exceptions
  * Differentiate among checked exception; unchecked exceptions and Errors
  * Create a try-catch block and determine how exceptions alter normal program flow
  * Describe the advantages of Exception handling
  * Create and invoke a method that throws an exception 
  * Recognize common exception classes(such as NullPointerException, ArithematicException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException)


## Working with Selected classes form the Java API 
  * Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods
  * Create and manipulate Strings
  * Crate and manipulate calendar date using classes from  java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter, java.time.Period
  * Declare and use Lambda expression that consumes a Lam
